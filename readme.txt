Display simple tournament brackets on any page using a shortcode. Supports manual seeding and tournaments up to 256 competitors.

== Description ==

Use this plugin to create simple tournament brackets. It supports single elimination head-to-head tournaments in sizes of 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, or 256 competitors. You can manually set the seeding when the tournament is started. Bracket colors can be modified in the WordPress backend -> Settings -> Tournaments page. 

You can display the brackets on any page using the `[simple-tournament-brackets tournament_id="$id"]` shortcode where **$id** corresponds to the *post_id* of the created tournament. The shortcode to use is also displayed for each tournament on the WordPress backend **All Tournaments** page.
